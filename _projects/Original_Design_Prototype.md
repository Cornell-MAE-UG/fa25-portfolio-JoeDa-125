For our mechanical design class, we were asked to design and prototype a device to solve a problem of our choosing. What our team ended up choosing was the market-defined problem of user's lack of time to go to the gym, which was negatively affecting both their mental and physical health. This project showcased innovative thinking, problem solving skills, and the ability to listen to user needs and feedback when developing tangible prototypes.

**Key Features**

- Original concept and customer polling for ideation
- CAD modeling + optimization
- Prototype fabrication + testing
- Refinement of initial prototype
- Documentation of design process
- Static analysis of design

**Creative Thinking**

This project demonstrated creative problem-solving skills and innovative engineering thinking. Real world challenges were addressed by our design, showcasing our ability to come up with new inventive solutions and create practical and effective designs.

**Skills Used**
- CAD Design
- Prototyping
- DFX
- Testing Protocols

**Design Process**
Here is an image of an early CAD design for the project. Also shown below is one of our early prototypes. It was discovered from early prototypes that our design was unbalanced and would tip over if no one was sitting in the chair. This problem was then addressed in future designs, with counterbalances placed along the chair to ensure stability during normal use.
